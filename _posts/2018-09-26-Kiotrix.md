Touted as an easy to root machine, I thought this would be a good starter to get going with doing writeups with 
penetration testing publically. Here we go.

## Enumeration
Enumerating the target  with NMAP was the first go. I first needed to find the box on the local subnet.
{% highlight javascript linenos %}
nbtscan 192.168.102.0/24
{% endhighlight %}

There was only one result at `192.168.102.132`

Taking a leaf from the great JollyFrogs thread at techexams.net 
(http://www.techexams.net/forums/security-certifications/110760-oscp-jollyfrogs-tale-3.html), 
I used the following few commands. 

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
nmap -Pn -sS --stats-every 3m --max-retries 1 --max-scan-delay 20 --defeat-rst-ratelimit -T4 -p1-65535 -oA /root/192_168_15_201T 192.168.15.201
{% endhighlight %}

The above resulted in this
