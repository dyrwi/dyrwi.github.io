PentesterLab is a site that is used to hone your pentesting abilities.
A site where you can delve into some interesting and deep topics. The topic of today is 
the UNIX badge, which as of October 2018 has 34 badges to complete. There are videos for all exercises
and doing exercises typically focus on one skill. There a few where you need to link what your learnt
previously to what you are doing now, but only a few.

The main idea behind the UNIX badge is to show you the command line of UNIX, Bash.
It starts off with simple ideas, how to change directory, display a text response of a file, 
extracting compressed files to commands where you can gain control of a system due to poor configuration using commands like
 sudo, sql, sqlite3, using [johntheripper](https://www.openwall.com/john/) and more.

I am certainly no expert in Bash or UNIX based configuration so the UNIX Badge by Pentesterlabs was
certainly a great experience. I wish I had studied this before taking my OSCP challenge, as some of the
UNIX based privilege escalation techniques would of been helpful.

You can experience Pentesterlabs for yourself at: [https://pentesterlab.com](https://pentesterlab.com)

The UNIX based exercises are located at: [https://pentesterlab.com/badges/unix](https://pentesterlab.com/badges/unix)
